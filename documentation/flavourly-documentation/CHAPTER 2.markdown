## <a name="_bookmark5"></a>Software Requirement Specification

#### 1. <a name="_bookmark6"></a>Overall Description

This project covers the general description of factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a brief description for those requirements, which are defined in the specification requirements and makes them easier to understand.

#### 2. Product Perspectives

Flavourly recipe management platform provides a comprehensive solution for recipe creation, verification, and discovery in a professional environment. The system allows recipe developers to create and submit recipes for professional verification while nutritionists can review and approve recipes with nutritional guidance. Users can access verified recipes with confidence, knowing they have been professionally reviewed and approved.

In recent years, recipe sharing platforms have become increasingly popular as people seek more convenient ways to discover and share culinary creations. However, traditional recipe platforms that rely on unverified user submissions lack the professional oversight and nutritional accuracy that modern users require. The main perspective of this product is to provide a new and professional way for users to create, verify, and discover recipes from anywhere in the world.

These systems require a web-based platform that integrates modern web technologies, database management systems, and professional verification workflows, which can handle a large number of users and recipe submissions simultaneously. It should provide an intuitive, user-friendly interface for recipe creation, verification, and discovery. Users should be able to easily navigate the platform, create recipes, submit them for verification, and discover verified recipes without any delay.

Additionally, the platform should provide detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, preparation steps, nutritional information, and verification status. Flavourly has the potential to generate significant value for recipe developers, nutritionists, and cooking enthusiasts by expanding their reach beyond traditional publishing methods and providing professional verification systems.

By conducting recipe verification online, the platform can reduce overhead costs and reach a global audience of potential users. Additionally, the platform can provide valuable data on user behavior and preferences, which can be used to optimize future recipe recommendations and verification processes.

The basic components of the Flavourly recipe management platform that provides enhanced service to recipe developers, nutritionists, and cooking enthusiasts consist of the following:

- Get user information such as name, email address, dietary preferences, and cooking skill level.
- Recipe creation and management technology helps enhance the recipe development environment.
- The platform provides comprehensive recipe information including ingredients, preparation steps, and nutritional data.
- The platform provides access to verified recipes and professional nutritionist reviews.
- Users can view recipe developer profiles and nutritionist credentials.
- Recipe verification statistics and analytics
- The system maintains recipe verification workflows and status tracking.
- The facility to view recipe collections, meal plans, and shopping lists.
- Interactive review and rating systems for user feedback and engagement.

#### 3. <a name="_bookmark7"></a>Design and Implementation Constraints

Flavourly Recipe Management Platform is a comprehensive system that allows users to create, verify, and discover recipes through a professional web-based interface. Nowadays, recipe management platforms are becoming a common solution for individuals looking to share and discover culinary creations from the comfort of their own homes.

Participating in recipe creation and verification through web platforms saves users a significant amount of time and eliminates the need to physically attend cooking classes or consult nutritionists in person. The recipe management platform is a complex system that requires efficient management, so the use of a software system helps to avoid errors and ensure that the recipe verification process runs smoothly.

The recipe management platform provides a convenient and efficient way for users to create, submit, and discover verified recipes from the comfort of their homes. The system eliminates the need for users to attend physical cooking classes or consult nutritionists in person, allowing them to save time and participate in recipe development from anywhere in the world.

The recipe verification system evaluates recipes based on nutritional accuracy, ingredient quality, and preparation methods set by professional nutritionists and the value of the recipe being submitted. The quality of the recipe may increase or decrease based on factors such as nutritional accuracy, ingredient quality, and preparation methods.

The recipe management platform provides an efficient and automated platform for nutritionists to conduct recipe verifications, while also allowing users to monitor and participate in real-time. The recipe management platform is designed to prevent the entry of invalid values in all fields. This project also offers improved editing, adding, and updating of recipe records.

User identification is used to maintain and update records promptly and accurately. The project's entire information is stored in the project database, and authorized users can retrieve and manage the data with ease. Only authorized users can access the necessary information, which is easily accessible from the application.

The application has an attractive and user-friendly interface where users can sign in or sign out. The system should notify users when their recipes have been reviewed or when the verification process is about to be completed. We have designed the whole system in three interfaces and implemented the functionalities with detailed working. We divided this project into different modules and worked on it in proper sequence. Some points show the sequence and diagrams.

- We have developed a recipe management platform (Flavourly) which we further divide into three user interfaces.
- In those interfaces, there will be separate dashboards for every user type.
- There will be a specific sign-in system through which users must pass for usage of further functionality.
- The system is designed to handle a large number of users simultaneously. As the number of recipe submissions increases, the system can scale up to handle the additional load without experiencing performance issues.
- There will be options for users to participate in recipe creation, verification, and discovery processes in real-time, with the ability to manage multiple recipes throughout the platform.

#### 4. <a name="_bookmark8"></a>Assumption and Dependencies

A recipe management platform is a software solution that provides users with a convenient platform to create, verify, and discover recipes from their web browsers.
