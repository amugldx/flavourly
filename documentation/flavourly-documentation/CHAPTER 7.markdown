## Tools and Technology

#### 7.1 Programming Languages

The Flavourly recipe management system is a modern web application that revolutionizes the recipe sharing and meal planning experience, providing a highly automated and personalized platform for users to create, share, and discover recipes in real-time. The platform is developed using modern web technologies, Flavourly enhances the recipe management process, offering a seamless and user-friendly interface for web users across desktop and mobile devices. The implementation involves the utilization of various platforms, languages, and tools to ensure optimal performance and functionality.

The application is built using TypeScript, the primary programming language for modern web development, known for its type safety and developer productivity. TypeScript enables the creation of efficient and reliable web applications, providing a solid foundation for the Flavourly recipe management system.

In addition to TypeScript, React is used for building the user interface (UI) of the application. React allows for the creation of reusable components and efficient state management, enabling easy customization and maintenance of the app's appearance and functionality.

The application integrates with PostgreSQL database for data storage and management, Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations, and Cloudinary for media file management and optimization. These integrations provide real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and cloud storage capabilities.

In the Flavourly recipe management system, we have integrated Cloudinary to provide media management capabilities, making the recipe sharing experience even more engaging and interactive for all users. Cloudinary's powerful infrastructure enables seamless image and video upload, optimization, and delivery for recipe photos and cooking demonstrations. With Cloudinary, users can upload high-quality recipe images that are automatically optimized for different devices and screen sizes.

The PostgreSQL database serves as the central repository for storing crucial user information, recipe-related data, and meal planning details. As users register and create recipes, their personal information, such as names, contact details, and dietary preferences, is securely stored in the PostgreSQL database. Additionally, the database maintains comprehensive records of the recipes created by users, including their ingredients, preparation steps, nutritional information, and verification status.

The platform utilizes modern web libraries and frameworks, such as React Query for data fetching and state management, to handle network requests and retrieve data from the server. These tools simplify the communication between the web application and the backend system, ensuring efficient data retrieval and updates. Furthermore, other functions are also integrated in order to enhance the system. This web application is implemented through following tools and technologies:

FRONT END REACT

The application uses React for building interactive user interface (UI) components and state management.

TYPESCRIPT

The application primarily developed using TypeScript programming language for type safety and better development experience.

NEXT.JS

Next.js serves as the full-stack framework providing both frontend and backend capabilities through API routes.

TAILWIND CSS

The application uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design and modern styling.

RADIX UI

The application integrates Radix UI components for accessible and customizable UI elements.

BACK END NEXT.JS API ROUTES

Next.js API routes connect Flavourly to PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM for data exchange.

Database PostgreSQL

Flavourly uses PostgreSQL database for data storage and management with Prisma ORM.

CLOUDINARY

The application integrates with Cloudinary for media file storage, optimization, and delivery.

VERCEL

The application is deployed on Vercel platform for hosting and continuous deployment.

Authentication NextAuth.js

Utilizing NextAuth.js for secure user authentication and session management in Flavourly.

Operating System

I have chosen to use modern web browsers and Node.js runtime as the foundation for creating a dynamic and user-friendly web application that works across all devices and platforms.

#### 7.2 Operating Environment

The operating environment refers to the software layer that exists between the web browser and the applications running on the device. It consists of two primary components: the user interface provided by a web browser and the application programming interface (API) to the web platform. The web browser is responsible for managing the lifecycle of web applications on the user's device. It handles tasks such as loading and rendering web pages, managing memory usage, and handling user interactions with the web apps. The API to the web platform allows developers to interact with the browser and access various services and functionalities provided by the web standards. This API enables web app developers to access system resources, use device features like the camera or microphone, and interact with other web apps securely. It is essential to understand that the operating environment is not a complete operating system itself but rather a middleware layer that bridges the gap between the web browser and the web applications. It provides a standardized and controlled environment for web apps to run efficiently and securely on the web platform, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and browser versions. This system is divided in three modules which are mentioned below:

· Public User
