# CHAPTER 4

## System Design and Architecture

#### 1. <a name="_bookmark15"></a>System Architecture Overview

The Flavourly recipe management platform is built using a modern, scalable architecture that ensures high performance, reliability, and maintainability. The system follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns, enabling efficient development, testing, and deployment processes.

The platform utilizes a client-server architecture where the frontend web application communicates with the backend API services through well-defined interfaces. This architecture provides flexibility, scalability, and maintainability while ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and browsers.

The system is designed with a microservices approach, where different functionalities are separated into distinct modules that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This modular design allows for better resource utilization, easier maintenance, and improved fault tolerance.
