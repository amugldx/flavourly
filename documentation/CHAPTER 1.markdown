#### 1. <a name="_bookmark1"></a>Introduction

A live streaming auction system is a modern way of conducting auctions where buyers can participate in bidding remotely via the internet. With this system, auctions can be broadcasted live on the internet, allowing buyers from anywhere in the world to bid on items from the comfort of their own homes. By providing a convenient and transparent platform for buyers and sellers, a live streaming auction system can revolutionize the traditional auction experience, making it accessible and convenient for everyone. Now a days, peoples are using different type of social media platform like Facebook, Instagram etc for participating in online auction. Although social media platforms are often used for marketing and advertising, they are not an ideal platform for conducting auctions. Social media platforms lack the necessary tools and features that are required to facilitate an auction system, such as real-time bidding, secure payment systems, and clear terms and conditions. Moreover, social media platforms do not offer the same level of transparency and credibility that dedicated auction platforms provide; social media platforms are not designed to handle large- scale bidding and payment transactions. For these reasons, dedicated auction platforms that are specifically designed for conducting auctions are the preferred choice for sellers and buyers who are looking for a secure and reliable auction system. Spark Buy Live is a state-of-the-art platform that enables participants to buy and sell goods in a real-time environment. Buyers can place real-time bids on the products while sellers can display their products via live broadcasting instead of placing the auction physically, vendors may reach a larger audience and get bidding from anywhere in the world. Buyers may view the bids in real-time and make informed judgments, which makes the system's bidding process more transparent and fair. A lot of efforts, time and hard work have been put into the completion of the project.

#### 27. Background

The prevalent view in various global circles is that man is presently living in an age growth of information gathering, processing and dissemination, popularly called the information age. For this reason, auctioneers and other stakeholders in the auction industry are demanding more kinds of information to support their auction management and operations, including real-time bidding data, buyer behavior analytics, and inventory management tools. They must therefore respond to the increasing requirement for information and data management. A live auction system provides evidence that registered users have permission to bid on items, participate in auction events, and have access to related services such as item tracking and bidding history. The design of a live auction system will be beneficial to auction houses and sellers by providing a platform to reach a wider audience, increase bidding activity, and maximize profit. Auctioneers will appreciate a system that can automate manual tasks such as bidding tracking, item management, and payment processing, while also meeting the increasing demand for online auction services. The ultimate expectation is to inspire a feasibility study aimed at providing proper guidance and awareness to any future potential investors in the live auction system Physical auctions are often limited to a local audience, which may restrict the potential number of bidders. Sometimes, Bidders may need to travel to the auction location, wait in line, and navigate a crowded and noisy environment in order to participate in the auction. Bidders may need to travel to the auction location, wait in line, and navigate a crowded and noisy environment in order to participate in the auction This would streamline the auction process and enhance the experience for both auctioneers and bidders.

This includes software developers, project consultants, and team managers. This document need not be read sequentially; users are encouraged to jump to any section they find relevant. Online Auction System is a mobile application that allows users to browse and bid on auction items online. This system is established for all peoples, users after gaining access from the administrator. Users can use this program directly on their mobiles and after the installation. The use of live auctions is a growing business, and this online system provides a convenient way for users to participate in auctions remotely from anywhere with an internet connection. This system allows users to browse and bid on auction items in real-time, and provides transparent and secure bidding processes; Hence, the live auction system deals with the maintenance of records of each item that is up for auction, along with the details of each auction event. However, the current manual process of managing these records is time-consuming and prone to errors, which can lead to disputes with customers. To address these issues and improve the auction experience for both buyers and sellers, we propose a software solution for an online live auction system. This document outlines the software requirements for the live auction system and is intended for the designer, developer, and maintainer of the software. The system must be able to manage the inventory of items up for auction, display auction details such as starting bids, bidding increments, and closing times.

#### 1. <a name="_bookmark4"></a>Existing System

The existing auction systems are not completely computerized and often lack interactivity for users. In the traditional auction process, participants must physically attend the auction and bid on items in person. However, this process can be inconvenient for those who cannot attend in person due to location, scheduling conflicts, or other reasons. Additionally, personally attending an auction can be time-consuming, and bidders may struggle to keep track of multiple auctions and items. Sellers may also have difficulty reaching potential buyers and accurately pricing their items. To address these issues, we have developed a live streaming auction system that automates the existing manual system using computerized equipment and specialized software. With this system, users can easily access auctions from their homes or offices and participate in the bidding process in real- time. Our online auction system offers a range of features, including the ability for users to place bids, and track their bidding history. Additionally, sellers can easily list items for auction and set reserve prices to ensure they receive fair market value for their goods. Through our system, users can access all necessary information and make informed decisions without the need for physical attendance. This streamlines the auction process and saves time for both buyers and sellers. In the traditional auction process, record-keeping and management of bids can be a complicated and time- consuming process. However, our online auction system automates these tasks, simplifying the process for both users and administrators.
