## Tools and Technology

#### 7.1 Programming Languages

· The Spark buy Live Auction System is an Android application that revolutionizes the auction experience, providing a highly automated and personalized platform for users to buy and sell items in real-time. The platform Developed using modern technologies, Spark Buy Live enhance the auction process, offering a seamless and user-friendly interface for mobile users. The implementation involves the utilization of various platforms, languages, and tools to ensure optimal performance and functionality.

· The application is built using Java, the primary programming language for Android development, known for its versatility and robustness. Java enables the creation of efficient and reliable mobile applications, providing a solid foundation for the Spark Buy Live

· In addition to Java, XML is used for designing the user interface (UI) of the application. XML allows for the separation of UI elements from the application logic, enabling easy customization and maintenance of the app's appearance and layout.

· The application may integrate with Firebase or a MYSQL database for real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and cloud storage capabilities.

· In the Spark Buy Live Auction System, we have integrated the Agora server to provide real-time communication capabilities, making the auction experience even more engaging and interactive for all participants. Agora's powerful server infrastructure enables seamless audio and video communication between bidders and auctioneers in real-time. With Agora, users can place bids while having live audio and video conversations.

· The MySQL database serves as the central repository for storing crucial user information, auction-related data, and order details. As users register and participate in auctions, their personal information, such as names, contact details, and billing addresses, is securely stored in the MySQL database. Additionally, the database maintains comprehensive records of the products put up for auction, including their descriptions, starting bids, and current bidding status.

· The platform may also utilize third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Volley, to handle network requests and retrieve data from the server. These tools simplify the communication between the Android application and the backend system, ensuring efficient data retrieval and updates. Furthermore, other functions are also integrated in order to enhance the system. This Android application is implementedthrough following tools and technologies:

FRONT END XML

The application use XML for layout design and user interface (UI) elements.

JAVA

The application primarily developed using Java programming language

BACK END PHP

PHP connects spark buy live to MySQL using APIs for data exchange

Database MySQL

Spark buy live used SQL database for data stored and management

FIREBASE

The application may integrate with Firebase database for real-time data synchronization, user authentication, and cloud storage capabilities.

Live Server Agora live server

Utilizing Agora Live Server for real-time streaming from Spark buy live

Operating System

I have chosen to use the Android Operating system as the foundation for creating a dynamic and user-friendly mobile application.

#### 7.2 Operating Environment

The operating environment refers to the software layer that exists between the Android operating system (OS) and the applications running on the device. It consists of two primary components: the user interface provided by an applications manager and the application programming interface (API) to the applications manager. The applications manager is responsible for managing the lifecycle of applications on the Android device. It handles tasks such as starting and stopping applications, managing memory usage, and handling user interactions with the apps. The API to the applications manager allows developers to interact with the applications manager and access various services and functionalities provided by the Android OS. This API enables app developers to access system resources, use device features like the camera or microphone, and interact with other apps securely. It is essential to understand that the operating environment is not a complete operating system itself but rather a middleware layer that bridges the gap between the Android OS and the applications. It provides a standardized and controlled environment for apps to run efficiently and securely on the Android platform, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and Android versions. This system is divided in three modules which are mentioned below:

· User

· Seller

· Buyer

The following are the platforms; languages and tools used in implementation of Spark buy live.
